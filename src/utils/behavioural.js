        "question": "What is your three weakness as a techie ?",
        "answer": "1.Time Estimation:\n-I struggle sometimes to accurately estimate the time required for tasks, particularly when working with complex code or legacy systems. To overcome this, I've begun breaking down projects into smaller sub-tasks and utilizing time-tracking tools to better fine-tune my estimates over time.\n\n2.Perfectionism:\n-I'm highly detail-oriented, and this sometimes causes me to over-spend time perfecting a feature rather than progressing. I've learned to balance quality and efficiency by setting more definitive deadlines and obtaining early feedback to ensure I'm on track to meet expectations without wasting too much time.\n\n3.Understanding BRD (Business Requirement Document):\n-There have been times when I've struggled to fully appreciate the nuances of a BRD, particularly when requirements are complex or poorly described. To overcome this, I've begun scheduling proactive meetings with stakeholders and asking pointed questions to make sure I'm clear on the requirements prior to beginning the technical implementation. This helps me to better align with business objectives and prevent misinterpretations down the line.",

        "question": "Rate yourself on the basis of your skill out of 3-5 ?",
        "answer": "I scored myself at 3.5, believing that I am highly technically skilled and experienced; yet recognizing that there is always something new to learn. A score of 5 would suggest perfection, something I believe unrealistic to attain in the world of technology, where best practice and the latest innovations are in a state of constant flux. I am dedicated to continued development, whether that is enhancing my skills in systems design, extending further into the field of performance optimization, or keeping abreast of new technologies. My score, to me, is indicative of both my existing capabilities and my desire to continue to develop professionally.",

        "question": "what are your  three strengths as a techie ?",
        "answer": "1.Problem-Solving and Debugging:\r\n-I have a natural inclination towards breaking down intricate problems and finding effective solutions. From debugging a malfunctioning piece of code to performance optimization, I enjoy analyzing the minutiae to solve issues effectively. For example, I effectively tackled a bug production that was affecting user transactions in a negative way by methodically isolating the faulty module and applying a fix, leading to a significant reduction in downtime.\r\n\r\n2.Continuous Learning and Adaptability:\r\n-The world of technology is ever-changing and dynamic, and I pride myself on staying abreast of the newest technologies and best practices. I am a firm believer in learning with or without the help of online tutorials, workshops, or trial and error. This flexibility has allowed me to pick up new frameworks and languages rapidly as required by my projects.\r\n\r\n3.Effective Communication and Team Collaboration:\r\n-I am of the opinion that effective communication is paramount in the successful delivery of projects. I work with cross-functional teams to ensure that technical specifications are converted into business acumen and vice versa. My capacity to break down intricate technical ideas has allowed me to bridge gaps between developers, designers, and stakeholders, thus ensuring smoother project flows and more desirable results.",
