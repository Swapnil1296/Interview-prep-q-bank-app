    "answer": "An interpreted programming language is a type of programming language in which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without the need for prior compilation into machine-language instructions. Instead of being translated into machine code at the start (like compiled languages), the source code is read and executed line by line or statement by statement by an interpreter.",

    "question": "List some key disadvantages of JavaScript ?",
    "answer": "JavaScript, despite its widespread use and versatility, has several key disadvantages that developers need to be aware of:\n\n1.   Security Issues  :\n   -   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  : JavaScript can be exploited to inject malicious scripts into web pages, leading to security vulnerabilities.\n   -   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  : Attackers can trick users into executing unwanted actions on a different website where the user is authenticated.\n   -   Code Injection  : Because JavaScript is executed on the client side, it can be manipulated by users, potentially leading to security breaches.\n\n2.   Browser Compatibility  :\n   -   Inconsistent Behavior  : Different browsers may interpret JavaScript code differently, leading to inconsistencies in how a script functions across various platforms.\n   -   Versioning Issues  : Not all users update their browsers regularly, which can result in JavaScript features not being supported by older browser versions.\n\n3.   Performance Issues  :\n   -   Single-Threaded Nature  : JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it can only execute one task at a time. This can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with complex computations.\n   -   Blocking Behavior  : Heavy computations or blocking scripts can cause the UI to become unresponsive.\n\n4.   Lack of Debugging Facilities  :\n   -   Console-Based Debugging  : While browser developer tools have improved, debugging JavaScript can still be challenging compared to other languages that offer more advanced integrated debugging environments.\n   -   Error Handling  : JavaScript's error handling mechanisms can sometimes be less robust, making it harder to track down and fix issues.\n\n5.   Dynamic Typing  :\n   -   Type-Related Errors  : The flexibility of dynamic typing can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs that are difficult to track down, especially in large codebases.\n   -   Runtime Errors  : Many errors in JavaScript occur at runtime rather than compile time, making it harder to catch and fix issues early in the development process.\n\n6.   Global Variable Usage  :\n   -   Pollution of Global Namespace  : In JavaScript, it's easy to accidentally create global variables, which can lead to conflicts and bugs that are difficult to debug.\n   -   Encapsulation Issues  : Lack of proper encapsulation can lead to code that is harder to maintain and understand.\n\n7.   Asynchronous Programming Challenges  :\n   -   Callback Hell  : Managing asynchronous operations using callbacks can lead to deeply nested code that is difficult to read and maintain.\n   -   Complexity with Promises and async/await  : While promises and async/await simplify asynchronous programming, they still add a layer of complexity compared to synchronous code.\n\n8.   Limited Standard Library  :\n   -   Feature Gaps  : JavaScript's standard library is less comprehensive compared to some other languages, requiring developers to rely on external libraries and frameworks for additional functionality.\n\n9.   Interpreted Language Overheads  :\n   -   Performance Penalties  : As an interpreted language, JavaScript can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java, especially for CPU-intensive tasks.\n",

    "question": "Difference between Loosely typed vs strongly typed vs dynamically typed language ?",
    "answer": "The terms \"loosely typed,\" \"strongly typed,\" and \"dynamically typed\" describe different aspects of how programming languages handle types. Here's a breakdown of each concept and how they differ from one another:\n\n       Loosely Typed vs. Strongly Typed:\n\n -These terms describe the level of strictness a language imposes on type conversions and type checking.\n\n         Loosely Typed (Weakly Typed):\n\n-   Definition  : In a loosely typed language, the language allows more flexibility in how types are handled and converted. Implicit type conversions (also known as coercions) are common, and the language may automatically convert types to perform operations.\n-   Examples  : JavaScript, PHP, Perl\n-   Characteristics  :\n  - Implicit type coercion: The language automatically converts types as needed.\n  - Fewer type-related errors at compile-time, but potentially more at runtime.\n  - More flexibility, but can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.\n\n  \n  let x = \"5\";\n  let y = x  2; // y becomes 10 (string \"5\" is implicitly converted to number 5)\n  \n\n         Strongly Typed:\n\n-   Definition  : In a strongly typed language, the language enforces strict rules on how types can be used and converted. Implicit conversions are either limited or not allowed, and type errors are caught at compile-time or runtime.\n-   Examples  : Java, Python, Haskell\n-   Characteristics  :\n  - Explicit type conversions: Types must be explicitly converted by the programmer.\n  - More type-related errors are caught at compile-time or runtime, improving reliability.\n  - Less flexibility, but more predictable behavior and fewer type-related bugs.\n\n  python\n  x = \"5\"\n  y = int(x)  2     y becomes 10 (explicit conversion from string to int)\n  \n\n       Dynamically Typed vs. Statically Typed:\n\nThese terms describe when type checking is performed.\n\n         Dynamically Typed:\n\n-   Definition  : In a dynamically typed language, types are checked at runtime. Variables can change type during execution, and the type of a variable is determined by the value it holds at any given time.\n-   Examples  : Python, JavaScript, Ruby\n-   Characteristics  :\n  - Type flexibility: Variables can change type dynamically.\n  - Easier to write and more flexible code, but potential for runtime type errors.\n  - No need to declare variable types explicitly.\n\n  python\n  x = 10         x is an integer\n  x = \"hello\"    x is now a string\n  \n\n         Statically Typed:\n\n-   Definition  : In a statically typed language, types are checked at compile-time. The type of a variable must be declared and cannot change, leading to more type safety and catching type errors before the program runs.\n-   Examples  : Java, C++, Go\n-   Characteristics  :\n  - Type consistency: Variable types are fixed after declaration.\n  - Type errors are caught early during compilation, reducing runtime errors.\n  - Requires more upfront type declarations, which can be verbose.\n\n  java\n  int x = 10;     // x is declared as an integer\n  x = \"hello\";    // Compile-time error: incompatible types\n  \n\n       Summary:\n\n-   Loosely Typed  : Languages allow implicit type conversions, offering flexibility but potentially leading to unexpected behaviors (e.g., JavaScript).\n-   Strongly Typed  : Languages enforce strict type rules, requiring explicit type conversions, leading to more reliable and predictable code (e.g., Java, Python).\n-   Dynamically Typed  : Type checking occurs at runtime, allowing variables to change types during execution (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n-   Statically Typed  : Type checking occurs at compile-time, with variable types fixed after declaration, catching type errors early (e.g., Java, C++).\n\nUnderstanding these distinctions helps in choosing the right language for a given task and writing code that leverages the strengths of each type system.",

    "question": "What are the JavaScript Data Types?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, there are several data types, which can be broadly classified into two categories:   Primitive Data Types   and   Reference Data Types (Objects)  . \n\n       Primitive Data Types\n\n1.   Number  : Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.\n2.   String  : Represents a sequence of characters used to form text.\n3.   Boolean  : Represents a logical entity and can have two values:  \"true \" or  \"false \".\n \n4.   Null  : Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a special keyword and only has one value:  \"null \".\n  \n5.   Undefined  : Indicates that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.\n   \n6.   Symbol  : Represents a unique identifier. Every symbol value returned from  \"Symbol() \" is unique.\n \n7.   BigInt  : Provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than the  \"Number \" type can handle.\n   \n       Reference Data Types (Objects)\n\n1.   Object  : Represents a collection of key-value pairs. It is the base for many other data types.\n  \n2.   Array  : A special type of object used for storing ordered collections.\n  \n3.

    "answer": "Undeclared and undefined variables are both related to variable usage in JavaScript but represent different states:\n\n       Undeclared Variables:\n\nAn undeclared variable is a variable that has been used in code without being formally declared (i.e., using the  \"var \",  \"let \", or  \"const \" keywords) anywhere within the scope. Using an undeclared variable leads to a runtime error in strict mode, while in non-strict mode, JavaScript creates a global variable with that name.\n\n       Undefined Variables:\n\nAn undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. When you try to access the value of an undefined variable, JavaScript returns the special value  \"undefined \".\n\nIn summary:\n\n-   Undeclared variables   are those that have not been formally declared anywhere in the scope.\n-   Undefined variables   are those that have been declared but not yet assigned a value, resulting in the variable having the value  \"undefined \".",

    "question": "What do you mean by global variables? Define the Declaration and Problem with Global Variable?",
    "answer": "Global variables in JavaScript are variables that are declared outside of any function, hence they are accessible from anywhere within the code, including other functions and scripts.\n\n       Declaration of Global Variables:\n\nGlobal variables can be declared using the  \"var \",  \"let \", or  \"const \" keywords outside of any function scope.\n\n       Problems with Global Variables:\n\nWhile global variables offer accessibility across the entire codebase, they can introduce various issues:\n\n1.   Name Conflicts  : Since global variables are accessible everywhere, there's a risk of unintentionally overriding their values due to name conflicts. This can happen when different parts of a large codebase use the same variable names.\n\n2.   Accidental Modification  : Any part of the code can potentially modify the value of a global variable, leading to unintended consequences and bugs. This makes it harder to track down the source of issues.\n\n3.   Scope Pollution  : As the codebase grows, the number of global variables can increase, leading to \"scope pollution.\" This makes it harder to maintain and understand the code because it's not clear where and how these variables are being used.\n\n4.   Dependency on Context  : Global variables create dependencies on the global context, making the code less modular and harder to test. It becomes challenging to isolate and test individual components since they rely on global state.\n\n5.   Performance Impact  : Accessing global variables can be slower compared to accessing local variables due to the need to traverse the scope chain.\n\n       Best Practice:\n\nIt's generally recommended to minimize the use of global variables and instead encapsulate data within functions or modules where possible. This approach helps to reduce the risk of naming conflicts, accidental modifications, and scope pollution, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. When variables need to be shared across multiple parts of the code, consider using techniques like dependency injection or module patterns to manage dependencies more effectively.",

    "question": "What do you mean by the ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, the  \"this \" keyword refers to the context within which a function is executed. Its value is determined by how a function is called and where it is called from. The value of  \"this \" can change dynamically based on the invocation context.\n\nHere are the common rules that determine the value of  \"this \":\n\n1.   Global Context  : When used in the global scope (outside of any function),  \"this \" refers to the global object ( \"window \" in browsers,  \"global \" in Node.).\n\n2.   Function Context  : Inside a function, the value of  \"this \" depends on how the function is called:\n   -   Function Invocation  : If a function is called as a standalone function (not as a method of an object),  \"this \" refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or  \"undefined \" (in strict mode).\n   -   Method Invocation  : If a function is called as a method of an object,  \"this \" refers to the object that owns the method.\n   -   Constructor Invocation  : If a function is called with the  \"new \" keyword,  \"this \" refers to the newly created instance of the object.\n\n3.   Arrow Functions  : Arrow functions do not have their own  \"this \" context. Instead, they inherit the  \"this \" value from the surrounding lexical context.\n\n4.   Event Handlers  : In event handler functions,  \"this \" typically refers to the element that triggered the event.\n\nUnderstanding how  \"this \" behaves in different contexts is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code, especially when working with object-oriented programming paradigms or event-driven programming. Incorrect usage of  \"this \" can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.",

    "question": "What do you mean by the “===” operator?",
    "answer": "The  \"=== \" operator, also known as the \"strict equality operator\" or \"identity operator,\" is a comparison operator in JavaScript. It compares two values for equality without performing type conversion. Here's what it means:\n\n       Strict Equality Operator (===):\n\n1.   Comparison  :\n   - The  \"=== \" operator checks whether the two operands are equal in value and of the same data type.\n   - It returns  \"true \" if the operands are equal without any type conversion, and  \"false \" otherwise.\n\n2.   Type Check  :\n   - In strict equality ( \"=== \"), both the value and the data type of the operands are compared.\n   - If the data types of the operands are different, they are considered unequal, even if their values are similar.\n\n\n4.   Advantages  :\n   - Using the  \"=== \" operator ensures that the comparison is strict and prevents unexpected behavior due to type coercion.\n   - It leads to more predictable and reliable code, especially in scenarios where type conversion could introduce bugs.\n\n       Summary:\n\n- The  \"=== \" operator in JavaScript checks for strict equality, comparing both value and data type.\n- It returns  \"true \" if both operands are equal without any type conversion, and  \"false \" otherwise.\n- Using  \"=== \" is preferred over  \"== \" for most comparisons, as it avoids the pitfalls of implicit type conversion and leads to more robust code.",

    "question": "What is Type Coercion in  JS?",
    "answer": "Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic or implicit conversion of one data type to another. This typically happens when operators or expressions are used with operands of different types, and JavaScript tries to convert one or both of the operands to a compatible type to perform the operation.\n\nThere are two types of type coercion:\n1. Implicit Coercion: JavaScript automatically converts the types when necessary.\n2. Explicit Coercion: The developer manually converts the types using functions or methods.\n\n\n\n Key Points:\n- Loose equality (==) performs type coercion and tries to compare values after converting them to a common type.\n- Strict equality (===) does not perform type coercion; both the value and the type must be the same.\n  \nType coercion can sometimes lead to unexpected results, so understanding how it works is important for debugging and writing reliable code.",

    "question": "Does JavaScript support automatic type conversion (AutoConversion)?",
    "answer": "Yes, JavaScript does support automatic type conversion, often referred to as \"type coercion\" or \"type conversion.\" This means that JavaScript can automatically convert values from one data type to another in certain situations, such as when performing operations or comparisons involving different data types.\r\n\r\nHere are some common scenarios where automatic type conversion occurs:\r\n\r\n1.   Numeric/String Conversion  :\r\n   - When a value of one type is used in a context that expects another type, JavaScript will attempt to convert it to the expected type.\r\n   - For example, concatenating a string with a number will convert the number to a string:\r\n\r\n     \r\n     let num = 10;\r\n     let str = \"The number is: \" + num; // \"The number is: 10\"\r\n     \r\n\r\n2.   Comparison Operations  :\r\n   - When comparing values of different types using comparison operators like  \"== \", JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both operands to a common type before making the comparison.\r\n   - For example, when comparing a string to a number using  \"== \", JavaScript will convert the string to a number if possible before making the comparison:\r\n\r\n     \r\n     \"10\" == 10; // true (string \"10\" is converted to the number 10)\r\n   \r\n\r\n3.   Boolean Conversion  :\r\n   - Values can be automatically converted to boolean values ( \"true \" or  \"false \") in contexts that expect boolean values, such as in  \"if \" statements or boolean operations ( \"&& \",  \"|| \",  \"! \").\r\n   - JavaScript treats certain values as \"falsy\" (e.g.,  \"0 \",   \",  \"null \",  \"undefined \",  \"NaN \"), and all other values are treated as \"truthy\".\r\n\r\n4.   Implicit Type Coercion  :\r\n   - JavaScript will implicitly coerce values to the expected type in certain situations, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood properly.\r\n   - For example, adding a number to a string using the  \"+ \" operator will implicitly convert the number to a string and perform string concatenation:\r\n\r\n     \r\n     5 + \"10\"; // \"510\"\r\n   \r\n\r\nWhile automatic type conversion can be convenient in some cases, it's important to understand how it works to avoid unexpected results and bugs in your code. In situations where clarity and predictability are important, explicit type conversion using functions like  \"parseInt() \",  \"parseFloat() \", or  \"String() \" is recommended.",

    "answer": "Variable typing in JavaScript means variables can store different data types and the data type of a variable can be dynamically changed during runtime of a program. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, so variables are not tied to any data type when the program gets compiled but, rather, the data type of a variable at runtime depends upon the type of value stored within it.\r\n\r\nThis dynamic typing provides flexibility and makes coding easier in most situations, but it also needs careful attention to data types to prevent unexpected behavior or errors. Some of the main points regarding variable typing in JavaScript are:\r\n\r\n1.   Dynamic Typing  : JavaScript variables can store values of any type, and the type of a variable may change over time as different values are stored in it.\r\n\r\n2.   Implicit Type Conversion  : JavaScript automatically performs implicit type conversion (type coercion) if required, converting values from one type to another in some operations or comparisons.\r\n\r\n3.   Data Types  : JavaScript has a number of data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, functions, symbols, and null/undefined values.\r\n\r\n4.   Type Checking  : JavaScript is dynamically typed, but you can still check the type using operators like  \"typeof \", which gives the data type of a value or variable.\r\n\r\n5.   Type Stability  : Although JavaScript supports dynamic typing, it is advisable to have type stability in your code for better readability and to minimize the chances of errors.\r\n\r\nIn general, variable typing in JavaScript is convenient and flexible but also needs careful attention from developers regarding data types and type conversions to guarantee code correctness and reliability.",

    "question": "Explain the difference between the “==” and “===” operator?",
    "answer": "The  \"== \" and  \"=== \" operators in JavaScript are used for comparison, but they behave differently in terms of strictness and type coercion.\n\n       Loose Equality Operator ( \"== \"):\n\n1.   Comparison  :\n   - The  \"== \" operator compares two values for equality, allowing type coercion if the operands are of different types.\n   - It attempts to convert the operands to a common type before making the comparison.\n\n2.   Type Coercion  :\n   - If the operands are of different types, JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both of them to a common type before comparing.\n   - This can lead to unexpected results, especially when comparing values of different types.\n\n3.   Examples  :\n   \n   5 == \"5\" // true (number 5 is coerced to string \"5\" before comparison)\n   null == undefined // true (both are considered equal in loose equality)\n   0 == false // true (number 0 is coerced to boolean false)\n   \n\n       Strict Equality Operator ( \"=== \"):\n\n1.   Comparison  :\n   - The  \"=== \" operator, also known as the strict equality operator, compares two values for equality without performing type coercion.\n   - It returns  \"true \" only if the operands are of the same type and have the same value.\n\n2.   Type Check  :\n   - In strict equality ( \"=== \"), both the value and the data type of the operands are compared.\n   - If the data types of the operands are different, they are considered unequal, even if their values are similar.\n\n3.   Examples  :\n   \n   5 === \"5\" // false (number 5 is not equal to string \"5\" in strict equality)\n   null === undefined // false (null and undefined are of different types)\n   0 === false // false (number 0 and boolean false are of different types)\n   \n\n       Summary:\n\n-   Loose Equality ( \"== \")  :\n  - Allows type coercion, converting values to a common type before comparison.\n  - Can lead to unexpected results due to type conversion.\n  - Use with caution, as it may not always produce intuitive results.\n\n-   Strict Equality ( \"=== \")  :\n  - Does not perform type coercion, comparing both value and data type.\n  - Ensures more predictable and reliable comparisons.\n  - Generally recommended for most comparisons to avoid unexpected behavior.",

    "question": "List the differences between .call() and .apply() and bind() ?",
    "answer": "The .call(), .apply(), and .bind() methods in JavaScript are all used to set the this value within a function.\n\nHere's a breakdown of their differences:\n\n   1.Call() The .call() method invokes a function with a given this value, and arguments provided individually. It takes the this value and a list of arguments as parameters and executes the function immediately.\n\n   \n    function test(arg1, arg2){\n      console.log(this.num, arg1, arg2); // 100, 10, 20\n    }\n    test.call({num: 100}, 10, 20);\n   \n\n   2.Apply() The .apply() method also invokes a function and sets the this value. However, .apply() accepts arguments as a single array. Like .call(), it executes the function immediately.\n\n   \n    function test(...arguments){\n      console.log(this.num, arguments);//100, [1,2,3]\n    }\n    test.apply({num: 100}, [1,2,3]);\n   \n\n   3.Bind() The .bind() method binds the this value to the function and returns a new function. It does not execute the function immediately. The returned function needs to be invoked separately.\n\n   \n    function test(arg){\n      console.log(this.number, arg);\n    }\n    let bindedFn = test.bind({number: 99}, \"argument\");\n    bindedFn(); // 99, \"argument\"\n   \n\nIn essence, .call() and .apply() are quite similar; the main distinction lies in how arguments are passed to the function. With .call(), arguments are passed individually, while .apply() expects an array of arguments[1]. Meanwhile, .bind() differs from both as it only creates a new function with the specified this value, requiring a separate invocation to execute the function. They are used to explicitly define what this should reference within the calling function. These methods are inherited by every function and are useful for callbacks and event handlers.\n",

    "question": "What do you understand by event bubbling?",
    "answer": "Event bubbling is a concept in JavaScript where events triggered on an element are propagated or \"bubbled\" up through its parent elements in the DOM tree. When an event occurs on a nested element (e.g., a button inside a div), the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element, then propagated up through its ancestor elements, triggering their respective event handlers along the way.\n\nHere's how event bubbling works:\n\n1.   Event Capture Phase  : When an event is triggered on an element, the browser first captures the event during the capture phase. During this phase, the event propagates down from the root of the DOM tree to the target element.\n\n2.   Target Element  : Once the event reaches the target element, it triggers the event handler bound to that element, allowing for specific actions to be performed in response to the event.\n\n3.   Event Bubbling Phase  : After the event has been handled by the target element, it then begins to bubble up through the ancestor elements in the DOM tree. This means that the same event is triggered on each ancestor element, allowing their event handlers to be executed in sequence.\n\nEvent bubbling allows for event delegation, which means you can attach a single event handler to a parent element and handle events for multiple child elements. This can lead to more efficient and manageable code, especially in cases where there are many dynamically created elements.\n\nHowever, event bubbling can also lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly, as events triggered on child elements may inadvertently trigger event handlers on parent elements as well. In such cases, event.stopPropagation() can be used to stop the propagation of the event to parent elements.",

    "question": "What is Deferred Script & Describe the role of deferred scripts in JS .",
    "answer": "In HTML, the  \"defer \" attribute is used with the  \"<script> \" element to specify that the execution of the script should be deferred until after the document has been parsed. When a script is marked as deferred, it will be executed after the HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed, but before the  \"DOMContentLoaded \" event is fired.\n\n       Role of Deferred Scripts:\n\n1.   Asynchronous Loading  : Deferred scripts are loaded asynchronously, meaning that they do not block the parsing of the HTML document. Instead, they are downloaded in parallel with other resources, such as CSS stylesheets and images.\n\n2.   Execution Timing  : Deferred scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML document, after the HTML document has been fully parsed. This ensures that the script has access to all elements in the document's DOM tree.\n\n3.   DOMContentLoaded Event  : Deferred scripts are executed before the  \"DOMContentLoaded \" event is fired, which indicates that the HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed. This allows scripts to manipulate the DOM or perform other actions as soon as the document is ready.\n\n4.   Improved Performance  : By deferring the execution of scripts until after the document has been parsed, deferred scripts can improve the performance of web pages by reducing the time it takes for the initial content to be displayed to the user.\n\n5.   Script Dependencies  : Deferred scripts are useful when you have scripts that depend on other resources or scripts that need to be executed in a specific order. By deferring the execution of scripts, you can ensure that dependent scripts are loaded and executed at the appropriate time.\n\nOverall, deferred scripts are a useful tool for optimizing the loading and execution of scripts in web pages, particularly for scripts that are not critical for rendering the initial content of the page but still need to be executed as part of the page's functionality.",

    "question": "What is closures in JavaScript? When are they used?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, a closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This lexical environment consists of any variables, objects, or functions that were in scope at the time the closure was created. The closure retains access to these variables even after the outer function has finished executing.\n\nHere are some key points about closures:\n\n1.   Function and Lexical Environment  : When a function is defined within another function (nested function), it forms a closure. The inner function has access to the variables and parameters of the outer function, as well as its own local variables.\n\n2.   Access to Outer Scope  : Closures allow inner functions to access and manipulate variables from the outer function, even after the outer function has returned. This behavior is known as \"closing over\" or \"capturing\" the variables.\n\n3.   Private Variables  : Closures are often used to create private variables and encapsulate functionality within a function scope. By defining variables within the outer function that are only accessible to the inner function, you can create a level of data hiding and encapsulation.\n\n4.   Maintaining State  : Closures can be used to maintain state across multiple function calls. Since variables in the outer scope are retained by the closure, their values can be modified and accessed across different invocations of the inner function.\n\n5.   Callbacks and Event Handlers  : Closures are commonly used in asynchronous programming, such as event handling and callbacks. They allow you to pass functions as arguments to other functions and maintain access to the surrounding context in which they were defined.\n\n6.   Memory Management  : Closures can also have implications for memory management, as they may retain references to variables and objects even after they are no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks if closures are not used carefully, especially in long-running applications.\n\n       \n\nClosures are a powerful and fundamental concept in JavaScript, and they are widely used in many programming patterns and techniques, including functional programming, asynchronous programming, and module patterns. Understanding closures is essential for writing expressive and efficient JavaScript code.",

    "question": "Explain passed by value and passed by reference.",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, \"passed by value\" and \"passed by reference\" refer to how data is handled when it is passed to a function. The difference is crucial in understanding how variables behave when they are passed to functions.\n\n 1. Passed by Value:\nWhen a primitive value (like a number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, or bigint) is passed to a function, it is passed by value. This means that a copy of the original value is passed to the function. Any changes made to the variable inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.\n\n\n 2. Passed by Reference:\nWhen a non-primitive value (like an object, array, or function) is passed to a function, it is passed by reference. This means that the function receives a reference (or address) to the original value, not a copy. Any changes made to the object or array inside the function will affect the original object or array outside the function because both the original and the copy point to the same memory location.\n\n \n Key Differences:\n- Primitive types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans) are passed by value.\n- Objects, arrays, and functions are passed by reference.\n\n Summary:\n- Passed by Value: The function gets a copy of the value.

    "answer": "A higher-order function in JavaScript is a function that either:\n\n1. Accepts one or more functions as arguments, or\n2. Returns a function as its result.\n\nThis is a fundamental idea in functional programming and makes your code more modular, reusable, and expressive.\n\n\n\n Key Features:\n\n- Accepting Functions as Arguments:\n - You can pass functions to other functions in order to customize behavior.\n- This enables you to abstract shared patterns and make your code more versatile.\n\n- Returning Functions:\n- A function may create and return another function.\n- This can be used for function factories or for currying, where you partially apply the arguments of a function.\n\n\n\n Use Cases:\n\n1. Array Methods:\n   - JavaScript array methods such as .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() are higher-order functions.\n\n\n2. Event Handlers:\n   - When you add an event listener, you're usually providing a callback function to process the event.\n  \n     \n\n3. Function Composition and Currying:\n- You can make functions that output new functions so that you can construct specialized functions from more generic ones.\n\n     \n\n4. Middleware in Frameworks:\n- In systems such as Express., higher-order functions are employed to define middleware functions that transform request/response objects or carry out certain operations prior to hitting the end route handler.\n\n5. Throttling and Debouncing:\n   - Higher-order functions can produce debounced or throttled functions to manage the frequency at which a function is called.\n   \n\n\n\n Summary:\n\nHigher-order functions give you the power to create more abstract and versatile code by enabling functions to take other functions as arguments. Whether you're dealing with array methods, event handling, or creating your own utility functions, having control over higher-order functions can make a huge difference in your capacity to write clean, maintainable JavaScript.",

    "question": "What is Currying in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "Currying in JavaScript is an interesting technique based on functional programming, where a function that is supposed to accept multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each of which accepts one argument. Rather than accepting all arguments at once, a curried function neatly returns a new function expecting the next argument, and this goes on until all arguments have been supplied.\n\n How Currying Works\n\n- Step-by-Step Argument Application:\n  In a curried function, each call takes a single argument, returning another function that eagerly expects the next argument. It is only when all the arguments have been supplied that the function is brought to life, running to reveal the final result.\n\n- Simplified Function Reuse:\n  Currying can help create more reusable functions, as it allows you to pre-configure a function with some arguments and create specialized versions.\n\n \n\n\n Advantages of Currying\n\n- Partial Application:\n  Currying enables you to supply some arguments of a function, and then define a new function. For instance:\n\n  \n  const addOne = curriedAdd(1);\n  const addOneAndTwo = addOne(2);\n  console.log(addOneAndTwo(3)); // Output: 6\n  \n\n- Code Reusability:\nBy writing partially applied functions, it is possible to reuse them in various parts of an application without duplicating the same logic.\n\n- Better Readability:\n  Currying can make functions more modular and readable, particularly when working with complicated operations that need multiple parameters.\n\n Real-World Applications\n\n- Event Handling:\n  Consider curried functions processing events, where the event type is the first argument, and the curried functions work with specific actions pertaining to the event.\n  \n- Configuration Functions:\n  When working with a function that takes configuration options, currying can be employed to create a configuration layer, with dynamic data to be added later.\n\n Conclusion\n\nIn JavaScript, currying is a fantastic tool that converts multi-argument functions into a series of single-argument functions, enabling partial application and cleaner, more modular code. This design pattern is widely applied in functional programming and is particularly useful when one needs to reuse or pre-configure functions for certain tasks.",

    "question": "Explain Scope and Scope Chain in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables, functions, and objects in a particular part of your code during runtime. The scope chain is the mechanism by which JavaScript resolves variable names by looking through nested scopes in a hierarchical order.\n\n\n\n 1. Scope\nScope defines the region where a variable or function can be accessed. JavaScript has three types of scope:\n- Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block.\n- Function (Local) Scope: Variables declared inside a function.\n- Block Scope: Variables declared inside a block (e.g., {} with let/const).(refer example1).\n\n \n\n\n\n 2. Scope Chain\nWhen a variable is referenced, JavaScript searches for it in the current scope. If not found, it moves up to the outer/parent scope, continuing until the global scope is reached. This hierarchy of nested scopes is called the scope chain.\n\n How It Works:\n1. Lexical Scoping: The scope chain is determined by the physical placement of functions/blocks in the code (not where they’re called).\n2. Closures: Inner functions retain access to their outer scope even after the outer function has executed. (refer example2).\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Key Concepts\n1. Variable Lookup:\n   - Moves inward → outward (current scope → outer scopes → global scope).\n   - If a variable isn’t found, a ReferenceError occurs.\n\n2. Lexical Environment:\n   - Each function/block creates a new lexical environment.\n   - Scopes are nested, forming a chain.\n\n3. Block Scope (ES6):\n   - let and const are block-scoped (confined to {}).\n   - var is function-scoped (ignores blocks like if/for).\n\n4. Closures:\n   \n   function outer() {\n     let outerVar = \"outer\";\n     return function inner() {\n       console.log(outerVar); // Still accessible via scope chain\n     };\n   }\n   const closureFunc = outer();\n   closureFunc(); // \"outer\"\n   \n\n\n\n Scope Chain vs. Execution Context\n- When a function is called, a new execution context is created, which includes:\n  - Its own variable environment (local variables).\n  - A reference to the outer lexical environment (scope chain).\n\n\n\n Common Pitfalls\n1. Accidental Global Variables:\n   \n   function leak() {\n     leaked = \"global\"; // ❌ No declaration → global variable!\n   }\n   \n2. Variable Shadowing:\n   \n   let x = \"global\";\n   function outer() {\n     let x = \"outer\"; // Shadows the global x\n     console.log(x); // \"outer\"\n   }\n   \n\n\n\n Summary\n- Scope: Defines where variables/functions are accessible.\n- Scope Chain: The hierarchy of scopes used to resolve variables.\n- Lexical Scoping: Scopes are determined by where code is written, not where it’s called.\n- Closures: Inner functions \"remember\" their outer scope via the scope chain.",

    "question": "What are object prototypes?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, object prototypes are the mechanism by which objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a\n [[Prototype]], an internal property that links it to another object (its prototype). This forms a prototype chain, enabling inheritance and shared behavior across objects.\n\n\n\n Key Concepts\n1. Prototype Chain:\n   - When accessing a property/method on an object, JavaScript:\n     1. Checks the object itself.\n     2. If not found, traverses up the prototype chain via [[Prototype]].\n     3. Stops at null (end of the chain) or returns undefined.\n   - Example:\n     \n2. prototype Property (Constructor Functions):\n   - Functions have a prototype property, used when the function is a constructor.\n   - Instances created with new inherit from the constructor’s prototype.\n   - Example:\n     \n     \n     \n\n3. __proto__ vs. prototype:\n   - __proto__ (deprecated): A property of an object pointing to its prototype.\n   - prototype: A property of constructor functions, defining the blueprint for instances.\n   - Use Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) and Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto) instead of __proto__.\n\n\n\n How Prototypes Work\n- Object Literals: Inherit from Object.prototype.\n  \n  const obj = {};\n  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === Object.prototype); // true\n  \n- Constructor Instances: Inherit from the constructor’s prototype.\n  \n  function Car() {}\n  const myCar = new Car();\n  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(myCar) === Car.prototype); // true\n  \n- Modifying Prototypes:\n  Changes to a prototype affect all existing and future instances:\n  \n  Car.prototype.drive = function() { console.log(\"Vroom!\"); };\n  myCar.drive(); // \"Vroom!\"\n  \n\n\n\n Prototype Inheritance\nJavaScript uses prototypal inheritance (not classical). You can create inheritance chains:\n\nfunction Animal(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\nAnimal.prototype.eat = function() { console.log(\"Eating...\"); };\n\nfunction Bird(name) {\n  Animal.call(this, name); // Inherit properties\n}\nBird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Inherit methods\nBird.prototype.fly = function() { console.log(\"Flying!\"); };\n\nconst eagle = new Bird(\"Eagle\");\neagle.eat(); // \"Eating...\" (from Animal.prototype)\neagle.fly(); // \"Flying!\" (from Bird.prototype)\n\n\n\n\n ES6 Classes (Syntactic Sugar)\nES6 class simplifies prototype-based inheritance:\njavascript\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }\n  eat() { console.log(\"Eating...\"); }\n}\n\nclass Bird extends Animal {\n  fly() { console.log(\"Flying!\"); }\n}\n\nconst eagle = new Bird(\"Eagle\");\neagle.eat(); // \"Eating...\"\neagle.fly(); // \"Flying!\"\n\n\n\n\n Important Notes\n1. Object.prototype is the top of the chain. Its prototype is null.\n2. Own Properties vs. Inherited:\n   - Use obj.hasOwnProperty(\"key\") to check if a property is on the object itself (not inherited).\n3. Shadowing:\n   - If an object defines a property with the same name as its prototype, the object’s own property takes precedence.\n   javascript\n   const obj = { toString: () => \"Custom toString\" };\n   console.log(obj.toString()); // \"Custom toString\" (not Object.prototype.toString)\n   \n\n\n\n Summary\n- Prototype: A template object from which other objects inherit properties/methods.\n- Prototype Chain: A lookup mechanism for resolving properties/methods.\n- Constructor Prototypes: Define shared behavior for instances.\n- Inheritance: Achieved via chaining prototypes (Object.create(), class syntax).",

    "question": "What is memoization?",
    "answer": "Memoization is an optimization technique used in computer science and programming to improve the performance of functions by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This avoids redundant computations and reduces the overall execution time of the program.\n\nHere are some key points about memoization:\n\n1.   Caching Results  :\n   - Memoization involves storing the results of function calls in a cache (such as an object or a map) based on the function's inputs (arguments). If the function is called again with the same inputs, the cached result is returned instead of recalculating the result.\n\n2.   Avoiding Redundant Computations  :\n   - By caching the results of function calls, memoization prevents redundant computations for the same inputs, especially for functions with expensive or time-consuming computations.\n\n3.   Improving Performance  :\n   - Memoization can significantly improve the performance of functions, especially in situations where the function is called repeatedly with the same inputs.\n\n4.   Pure Functions  :\n   - Memoization is most effective with pure functions, which produce the same output for the same inputs and have no side effects. Pure functions are deterministic and can safely be memoized.\n\n5.   Implementation  :\n   - Memoization can be implemented manually by storing the results of function calls in a cache object.

    "answer": "A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It provides a way to handle asynchronous tasks in a more readable and structured way compared to traditional callback-based approaches.\nPromises in JavaScript are used to handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or executing code that takes some time to complete. They provide a cleaner and more flexible way to manage asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches.\n\nHere are some key points about promises and their uses:\n\n1.   Asynchronous Operations  :\n   - Promises are primarily used to handle asynchronous operations, where the result of the operation is not immediately available and may take some time to complete.\n\n2.   Cleaner Code  :\n   - Promises allow asynchronous code to be written in a more sequential and readable manner, avoiding deeply nested callback functions (known as \"callback hell\") and improving code maintainability.\n\n3.   State Management  :\n   - Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. They represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.\n   - When a promise is pending, the operation is still in progress. When it is fulfilled, the operation has completed successfully, and the promise resolves with a value. When it is rejected, an error has occurred, and the promise rejects with an error object.\n\n4.   Chaining  :\n   - Promises support method chaining, allowing multiple asynchronous operations to be chained together in a sequential manner.\n   - Each promise in the chain returns a new promise, which allows for the propagation of success or failure through the chain.\n\n5.   Error Handling  :\n   - Promises provide built-in error handling mechanisms through the use of the  \"catch \" method, allowing errors to be caught and handled in a centralized manner.\n\n6.   Composition  :\n   - Promises can be composed together using methods like  \"Promise.all \" and  \"Promise.race \".  \"Promise.all \" waits for all promises to be fulfilled, while  \"Promise.race \" waits for the first promise to be settled (either fulfilled or rejected).\n\n",

    "answer": "Generator functions in JavaScript are special types of functions that enable the creation of iterators, allowing iterative control flow using the  \"yield \" keyword. Unlike regular functions that execute to completion and return a single value, generator functions can pause and resume their execution, yielding multiple values one at a time.\n\nHere are key points about generator functions:\n\n1.   Syntax  :\n   - Generator functions are defined using the  \"function  \" syntax or the  \"function  \" keyword followed by the function name.\n   - Within a generator function, the  \"yield \" keyword is used to pause the function's execution and produce a value.\n\n2.   Iterator Protocol  :\n   - Generator functions automatically implement the iterator protocol, making them iterable. They return an iterator object that can be used to iterate over the values produced by the generator.\n\n3.   Stateful  :\n   - Generator functions maintain their internal state between successive calls, allowing them to resume execution from where they were last paused.\n   - The  \"yield \" keyword not only produces a value but also suspends the generator's execution, allowing it to be resumed later.\n\n4.   Iterable  :\n   - Generator functions produce iterable sequences of values, making them useful for generating sequences of data or handling asynchronous operations in a sequential manner.\n\n5.    \"next() \" Method  :\n   - The iterator object returned by a generator function has a  \"next() \" method that can be used to resume the execution of the generator and retrieve the next yielded value.\n   - Each call to  \"next() \" returns an object with two properties:  \"value \", which contains the yielded value, and  \"done \", which indicates whether the generator has finished producing values.\n\n",

    "answer": "Named functions, anonymous functions, and arrow functions are different ways to define functions in JavaScript, each with its own syntax and behavior. Here's a comparison of these types of functions:\r\n\r\n1.   Named Function:  \n\r\n   - A named function is a function that has a name identifier, which can be used to reference the function within its scope and from outside.\r\n   - Named functions are typically defined using the  \"function \" keyword followed by the function name and the function body.\r\n   - They are useful when the function needs to be referenced by name, such as for recursion or event handling.\r\n   - Example:\r\n    \r\n     function add(x, y) {\r\n         return x + y;\r\n     }\r\n\r\n2.   Anonymous Function:  \n\r\n   - An anonymous function is a function that does not have a name identifier and is typically defined inline without a name.\r\n   - Anonymous functions are often used as function expressions, where they are assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function.\r\n   - They are useful for one-time use or when a function does not need to be referenced by name.\r\n   - Example:\r\n  \r\n     const add = function(x, y) {\r\n         return x + y;\r\n     };\r\n    \r\n\r\n3.   Arrow Function:  \n\r\n   - An arrow function is a concise syntax for defining functions introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).\r\n   - Arrow functions are always anonymous, meaning they do not have a name identifier by default.\r\n   - They are defined using the arrow ( \"=> \") syntax, which can have either a concise or a block body.\r\n   - Arrow functions have lexical scoping of  \"this \", meaning they inherit  \"this \" from the surrounding code.\r\n   - They are commonly used for short, one-liner functions or for preserving the value of  \"this \".\r\n   - Example:\r\n     \r\n     const add = (x, y) => x + y;\r\n   ",

    "question": "Explain the Hoisting in Named functions , Anonymous function & Arrow function ",
    "answer": "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, there are some differences in how named functions, anonymous functions, and arrow functions are hoisted:\n\n1.   Named Function:  \n\n   - Named functions are hoisted completely. This means both the function name and its implementation are hoisted to the top of their containing scope.\n   - This allows you to call a named function before its actual declaration in the code, as the function declaration is processed first during hoisting.\n   - Example:\n \n     // Function call before declaration\n     console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5\n\n     // Function declaration\n     function add(x, y) {\n         return x + y;\n     }\n     \n   - During hoisting, the entire  \"add \" function, including its name and implementation, is hoisted to the top of the scope.\n\n2.   Anonymous Function (Function Expression):  \n\n   - Function expressions, including anonymous functions, are hoisted differently compared to named functions.\n   - Only the variable declaration (if using  \"var \",  \"let \", or  \"const \") is hoisted to the top of the scope, not the function implementation.\n   - This means that if you try to call an anonymous function before its declaration, you will encounter a  \"TypeError \" indicating that the variable is not a function.\n   - Example:\n    \n     // Function call before declaration\n     // console.log(add(2, 3)); // Error: add is not a function\n\n     // Function declaration (as a function expression)\n     const add = function(x, y) {\n         return x + y;\n     };\n \n   - During hoisting, only the  \"add \" variable declaration is hoisted to the top of the scope, but the function implementation remains in place.\n\n3.   Arrow Function:  \n\n   - Arrow functions, like anonymous functions, are also hoisted differently compared to named functions.\n   - Similar to anonymous functions, only the variable declaration (if using  \"var \",  \"let \", or  \"const \") is hoisted to the top of the scope, not the function implementation.\n   - This means that if you try to call an arrow function before its declaration, you will encounter a  \"ReferenceError \".\n   - Example:\n     \n     // Function call before declaration\n     // console.log(add(2, 3)); // Error: Cannot access 'add' before initialization\n\n     // Function declaration (as an arrow function)\n     const add = (x, y) => x + y;\n     \n   - During hoisting, only the  \"add \" variable declaration is hoisted to the top of the scope, but the arrow function implementation remains in place.\n\n",

    "question": "Difference between Statement & Expression ?",
    "answer": "In simple terms:\r\n\r\n- An   expression   is like a calculator. It does something and gives you a result or value. For example:  \r\n  - 2 + 3  gives 5 .  \r\n  - \"Hello\" + \" World\"  gives \"Hello World\" .  \r\n\r\n- A   statement   is like a command. It tells the computer to do something but doesn’t always give you a value. For example:  \r\n  - if (x > y) { console.log(\"x is bigger\"); }  is a statement that tells the computer to check something and do an action if it's true.  \r\n\r\n    Key Difference:\r\n-   Expression  : Think of it as \"What is the result?\"  \r\n-   Statement  : Think of it as \"What action should be done?\"",

    "answer": "Both slice() and splice() are JavaScript array methods, but they have different purposes and behaviors. Here's a clear explanation:\n\n\n\n 1. slice()\n\n Purpose:\n- Extracts a portion of an array and returns a new array.\n- Does not modify the original array.\n\n Syntax:\n\narray.slice(start, end)\n\n\n Parameters:\n- start: The index where the extraction begins (inclusive).\n- end (optional): The index where the extraction ends (exclusive). If omitted, it slices until the end of the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2. splice()\n\n Purpose:\n- Modifies the original array by adding, removing, or replacing elements.\n\n Syntax:\n\narray.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)\n\n\n Parameters:\n- start: The index where changes will begin.\n- deleteCount: The number of elements to remove. If 0, no elements are removed.\n- item1, item2, ... (optional): Elements to add to the array at the start position.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "What is strict mode in  ?",
    "answer": "Strict mode in JavaScript is a way to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in your code. It is activated by including the string \"use strict\"; at the top of a script or function. It helps catch common coding mistakes, makes the code more secure, and often improves performance.\n\nBenefits of Strict Mode:\n1.Prevents accidental globals and enforces proper scoping.\n2.Allows JavaScript engines to optimize code more effectively.\n3.Forces developers to write cleaner, more modern JavaScript.\nLimitations:\n1.It can only be applied to entire scripts or individual functions. You cannot selectively enable strict mode for specific blocks of code.\n2.It might break older, poorly written code, so it's best used in modern projects.\n",

    "question": "What is Shallow copy & Deep copy ?",
    "answer": " Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy (Simplified)\n\n\n\n Shallow Copy\nA shallow copy makes a copy of an object or array, but it only copies the top-level values. If the object has nested objects (objects inside objects), it doesn't create a new copy of those nested objects. Instead, it shares the nested objects between the original and the copied object.\n\n Example:\nImagine copying a book. The title and cover are copied, but if the book has notes inside, the copy will just point to the same notes as the original.\n\n Code Example:\n\nconst original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };\n\n// Shallow copy\nconst shallowCopy = { ...original };\n\n// Changing the nested object in the copy\nshallowCopy.b.c = 42;\n\nconsole.log(original.b.c); // Output: 42 (both share the same nested object)\n\n\n\n\n Deep Copy\nA deep copy makes a full, independent copy of an object or array. It duplicates everything, including nested objects or arrays. If you change something in the copied object, it won’t affect the original object.\n\n Example:\nImagine copying a book and also copying all the notes inside the book. Now the copy has its own notes, and changes in one book don’t affect the other.\n\n Code Example:\n\nconst original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };\n\n// Deep copy\nconst deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));\n\n// Changing the nested object in the copy\ndeepCopy.b.c = 42;\n\nconsole.log(original.b.c); // Output: 2 (the original is not affected)\n\n When to Use Them?\n- Use shallow copy when you don’t plan to modify nested data.\n- Use deep copy when the copied data must be completely separate from the original.\n\n\n\n",

    "answer": "forEach() and map() are both array methods in JavaScript used for iterating over arrays, but they have some key differences:\n\n forEach()\n- Purpose:  \n  Used for executing a provided function on each element in the array.\n  \n- Return Value:  \n  It does not return a new array; it returns undefined.\n  \n- Usage:  \n  Best suited for performing side effects, such as modifying external variables or logging values.\n  \n- Example:\n  \n  const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n  numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num  2)); // Logs: 2, 4, 6\n  \n\n map()\n- Purpose:  \n  Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.\n  \n- Return Value:  \n  Returns a new array with transformed values.\n  \n- Usage:  \n  Ideal when you need to transform each element in the array and work with the new array.\n  \n- Example:\n  \n  const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n  const doubled = numbers.map(num => num  2);\n  console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]\n  \n\n Key Differences:\n- Return:  \n  forEach() returns undefined, while map() returns a new array.\n  \n- Side Effects vs Transformation:  \n  forEach() is used when you need to perform operations for side effects, and map() is used for transforming data.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "Explain how async await works",
    "answer": "async/await is a syntax introduced in ES2017 (es8) that simplifies working with promises, allowing you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous, readable manner.\n\n How It Works:\n\n1. Async Functions:  \n   - When you declare a function with the async keyword, it automatically returns a promise.\n   - Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause execution until a promise settles (either resolved or rejected).\n\n2. Await Keyword:  \n   - The await keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve.\n   - It can only be used inside an async function.\n   - When the promise resolves, await returns the resolved value. If the promise is rejected, it throws an error, which can be caught using try...catch.\n\n3. Syntactic Sugar for Promises:  \n   - async/await doesn't replace promises; it simplifies promise consumption by making asynchronous code appear synchronous.\n   - This leads to clearer, more maintainable code, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.\n\n \n",

The execution of getData() pauses until fetchData() resolves, then assigns the resolved value to result.\n\n- Error Handling:  \n  If fetchData() were to reject, the error would be caught in the catch block, allowing for centralized error management."

    "question": "What is the difference between   sort()  and  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b) ?",
    "answer": "The difference between  sort()  and  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)  lies in how they handle sorting and what type of sorting they perform:\n\n    1.  sort()  (without a comparator):\n- Default Behavior: The  sort()  method, when called without a comparator, converts each element of the array to a string and sorts them lexicographically (alphabetically). This means the elements are compared as strings, and not as numbers, so their order may not be what you expect for numbers.\n  \n- Example:\n\n     \n  const arr = [10, 1, 21, 2];\n  arr.sort();\n  console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 10, 2, 21]\n     \n\n  In this case, the array is sorted alphabetically based on the string values, not numerically. So,  '10'  comes before  '2'  because  '1'  is lexicographically less than  '2' .\n\n    2.  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)  (with a comparator):\n- Behavior: When you provide a comparator function like  (a, b) => a - b  to the  sort()  method, it sorts the elements numerically (or based on any custom logic you define in the comparator). The comparator function receives two arguments ( a  and  b ) and returns:\n  - A negative number if  a  should come before  b .\n  - A positive number if  a  should come after  b .\n  -  0  if  a  and  b  are considered equal.\n\n- Example:\n\n  const arr = [10, 1, 21, 2];\n  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 2, 10, 21]\n     \n\n  Here, the array is sorted in ascending numerical order because of the comparator function  (a, b) => a - b .\n\n    Summary of Differences:\n-  sort()  (without a comparator): Sorts elements as strings, which might not work as expected for numbers.\n-  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b) : Sorts elements numerically (or according to the logic you define in the comparator). This is the correct approach for sorting numbers in ascending order.\n\n    When to Use:\n- Use  sort()  without a comparator for sorting strings or when the default lexicographical sort is fine.\n- Use  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)  for sorting numbers or when you need specific sorting logic.",
